          On the Add Expense page, you'll see fields to input the necessary information. Start by entering the
          amount of the expense in the designated field. Be sure to input the accurate numerical value without
          any currency symbols. Next, select the appropriate category for your expense from the provided dropdown
          menu. Categories help you organize and analyze your spending habits effectively. Choose the category
          that best fits the nature of your expense, such as "Food," "Transportation," or "Entertainment." Then,
          provide a brief description of the expense in the corresponding field. This description can include
          additional details about the purchase or transaction to help you identify it later. Once you're satisfied
          with the information entered, click the "Add Expense" button to save the expense to your account.
          Once you're satisfied with the information entered, click the "Add Expense" button to save the expense
          to your account. If you have more expenses to add, you can repeat the process by clicking on the "Add
          Expense" button again and entering the details for each expense individually.
